    <p>A galaxy is a system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, 
        and dark matter bound together by gravity.[1][2] The word is derived from 
        the Greek galaxias (γαλαξίας), literally 'milky', a reference to the Milky 
        Way galaxy that contains the Solar System. Galaxies, averaging an estimated 
        100 million stars,[3] range in size from dwarfs with less than a thousand stars,[4] 
        to the largest galaxies known – supergiants with one hundred trillion stars, each orbiting 
        its galaxy's centre of mass. Most of the mass in a typical galaxy is in the form of dark matter,
         with only a few per cent of that mass visible in the form of stars and nebulae. Supermassive
          black holes are a common feature at the centres of galaxies.

        Galaxies are categorised according to their visual morphology as elliptical,[5] spiral,
         or irregular.[6] The Milky Way is an example of a spiral galaxy. It is estimated that 
         there are between 200 billion[7] (2×1011) to 2 trillion[8] galaxies in the observable universe.
          Most galaxies are 1,000 to 100,000 parsecs in diameter (approximately 3,000 to 300,000 light years)
           and are separated by distances in the order of millions of parsecs (or megaparsecs).
           For comparison, the Milky Way has a diameter of at least 26,800 parsecs (87,400 ly)[9][a] and is separated 
           from the Andromeda Galaxy, its nearest large neighbour, by just over 750,000 parsecs (2.5 million ly).[12]

         The space between galaxies is filled with a tenuous gas (the intergalactic medium) with an average density of 
         less than one atom per cubic metre. Most galaxies are gravitationally organised into groups, clusters and superclusters.
          The Milky Way is part of the Local Group, which it dominates along with the Andromeda Galaxy. The group is part of the
           Virgo Supercluster. At the largest scale, these associations are generally arranged into sheets and filaments surrounded 
           by immense voids.[13] Both the Local Group and the Virgo Supercluster are contained in a much larger cosmic structure named Laniakea.[14]
